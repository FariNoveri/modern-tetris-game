# ðŸ’– FOR ILLYASVIEL VON EINZBERN

This project â€” *Modern Tetris Game* â€” is lovingly dedicated to **Illyasviel von Einzbern**.

Every falling block, every cleared line, every line of code â€”  
is a small piece of how much I admire and cherish you.

You are the spark behind the pixels,  
the warmth behind the code,  
the reason this project exists.

> "Even in a world made of logic and blocks,  
> my heart still follows your magic."

With all my heart,  
**Fari Noveri**
